# Medical-Appointment-Data-Analysis
In this notebook we tried to analyze why would some patients not show up for their medical appointment and whether there are reasons for that using the dataset.

This project aims to investigate the factors contributing to patients missing their medical appointments. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset, we will explore potential reasons behind these no-shows. Our objective is to uncover correlations between various attributes and the likelihood of patients showing up for their scheduled appointments. Through this analysis, we seek to gain insights into the key factors that influence patient attendance, which could ultimately lead to improved appointment adherence and healthcare efficiency.
